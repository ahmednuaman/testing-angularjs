# Testing AngularJS

A simple application structure for AngularJS that includes end to end testing and production deployment. 

## Starting off
1. Make sure you have [`nodejs`](http://nodejs.org) installed and you can access `npm`.
2. You then need to install (globally, you may need to `sudo` this) `grunt-cli`, `bower` and `karma`.
3. Clone this repo and inside the folder run `grunt install`.
4. Write some codes!

## Running the tests
Simply run `grunt`.

## Packaging for production
This'll package up the whole application and stick it into a folder called `build`; to achieve this simply run `grunt package`.
